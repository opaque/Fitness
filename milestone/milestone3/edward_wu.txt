The Tubed it had a feature where you can like and dislike a show in a specific category. I found
this ot be very clever, along with the fact that the shows auto sort based on the nubmer of likes/dislike. However,
the dislikes can't go under 1, which I find to be very artificial. Also any individual can vote dislike
or like multiple times, which would allow voting manipulation to increase the popularity of a 
specific tv show.
