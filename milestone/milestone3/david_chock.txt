Feature: They allow users to enter in their SMS for notification.

The core functionality seems to support SMS, authlogic, and a mail plugin. I really like the idea of SMS
because it is a good idea to notify people by phone with shared event. However, a lot of their pages still
seem to cause the web page to crash, and after entering in my SMS number that field disappeared and never
resurfaced again. Even though it states that completing tasks is a feature, I am unable to run it. It seems 
like their design is ripe for the composite pattern as there are individual users and actions and group of 
users and their actions.
