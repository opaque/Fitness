You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given /^I am a user$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Given /^I have a registered account$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When /^I enter in the correct username and password$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When /^I click "([^"]*)"$/ do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^I should see my home page$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Given /^I am not yet on the graph page$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When /^I click on the graph tab$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^I should see my workout data presented on the default graph$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Given /^I am in the graph tab$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When /^I click on an alternative graph link$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^I should see my workout data presented in that format$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end
