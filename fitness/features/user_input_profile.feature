	Scenario: User inputs data into profile
		Given blank profile 1 exists
		When I am on the edit profile page for profile 1
		  And I fill in "profile_first_name" with "John"
		  And I fill in "profile_last_name" with "Smith"
		  And I fill in "weight" with "150"
		  And I fill in "height" with "70"
